✨ Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is almost ready ✨.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/getting-started/tutorials/angular-standalone-tutorial?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Features

### Domain Aliases

Services may use different names for domains than the canonical name. The catalog application captures and displays these service-specific aliases to help understand how different systems refer to the same data concepts.

**Example:**
- **Domain**: Commercial Items (canonical name)
- **JPharm**: Refers to it as "References"
- **Other Services**: Use the standard name "Commercial Items"

**Where aliases appear:**
- **Domain List**: Shows a count of service-specific names and displays them as tags
- **Service View**: Displays domains with their aliases in the format "Domain Name (known as: Alias)"
- **Data Flow Diagram**: Annotates service nodes with aliases below the service name

**Data Model:**
Aliases are defined in the data flow JSON files (`src/assets/*-data-flow.json`) by adding an optional `aliases` array to service nodes:

```json
{
  "id": "JPharm",
  "modifies": false,
  "aliases": ["References"]
}
```

**Note**: Only add the `aliases` field when a service uses a different name than the canonical domain name. Omit it when the service uses the standard name to avoid redundancy.

## Run tasks

To run the dev server for your app, use:

```sh
npx nx serve catalog
```

To create a production bundle:

```sh
npx nx build catalog
```

To see all available targets to run for a project, run:

```sh
npx nx show project catalog
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects.

To generate a new application, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/angular:app demo
```

To generate a new library, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/angular:lib mylib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.

## Install Nx Console

Nx Console is an editor extension that enriches your developer experience. It lets you run tasks, generate code, and improves code autocompletion in your IDE. It is available for VSCode and IntelliJ.
