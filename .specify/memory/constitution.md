# Domain and Service Catalog Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Clear Visual Representation
The application MUST provide a clear and intuitive graph-based visualization of the relationships between domains and services. This is the primary interface for users to understand the service landscape.

### II. Bidirectional Traceability
The application MUST allow users to trace dependencies in both directions: from a domain to its services and from a service to all associated domains. This is critical for understanding the impact of changes.

### III. Data Integrity and Uniqueness
The system MUST enforce the uniqueness of domains and services to prevent duplication and ensure data accuracy. This is fundamental to providing a reliable source of truth.

### IV. Architectural Insight
The application MUST provide views and tools that offer clear insights into the service architecture, including impact analysis for retiring services. The goal is to support architectural decision-making.

### V. Extensibility and Modularity
The system MUST be designed in a modular way to easily allow the addition of new domains and services without impacting existing data.

## Project Description

This is a new UI application which will have a catalog of domains as well as services. The user will be able to add new domains, new services. Then the user will be able to add a source service, then a source service may go to one or more services. And so on, thus creating a chain of services a single domain may go through. The user would want to be able to see a graph of services a domain can go through. The user may also select a service and see all the domains going through this service. This is meant to help understand the architecture used to create our final product offerings which will be categorized as services. It should help us understand what happens if we need to retire a single service but also whether we may have multiple copies of the same domain.

## Development Workflow

Development shall follow the guidelines in `GEMINI.md`. All changes must be accompanied by appropriate tests and pass linting and formatting checks.

## Governance

This Constitution is the single source of truth for the project's core principles. Any proposed change that violates these principles requires a formal amendment to this document. All code reviews must validate compliance with these principles.
