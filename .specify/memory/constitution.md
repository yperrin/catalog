# Data Domain & Service Catalog Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Clear Data Ownership
The system must clearly define the service that is the source of a domain. The originating service is considered the ultimate source of truth for that domain's data.

### II. Traceable Chain of Custody
Every domain's journey through different services must be recorded and auditable. This includes the sequence of services and the timestamps of transfers.

### III. Service-Centric View
The system must provide a clear and comprehensive view of all domains a service interacts with, both as a source and as a consumer.

### IV. Domain-Centric View
The system must provide a clear and comprehensive view of the entire service chain for any given domain, from origin to its final destination.

### V. Extensibility
The system must be designed to allow for the seamless addition of new domains and services without requiring fundamental architectural changes.

## Governance

This constitution is the single source of truth for the project's guiding principles. All development, features, and architectural decisions must align with it. Amendments to this constitution require a documented proposal, review, and approval process.
