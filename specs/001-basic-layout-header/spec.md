# Feature Specification: Basic Application Layout with Header

**Feature Branch**: `001-basic-layout-header`  
**Created**: 10/31/2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "create the basic look of the application with a header, the header will include the title of the application and 2 menus pointing to home pages for domains and services."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-31

- Q: What should happen if a navigation link in the header is broken or the target page is unavailable? → A: Clicking the link should show a "Page Not Found" error.
- Q: What level of accessibility should the header adhere to? → A: WCAG 2.1 Level AA.
- Q: The spec notes that a responsive layout is out of scope. How should this be handled? → A: Do nothing; the informal note is sufficient.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Application Header (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to see a consistent header at the top of every page so that I can easily identify the application and navigate to key sections.

**Why this priority**: This is the most fundamental UI element that establishes the application's identity and primary navigation.

**Independent Test**: The header can be tested on a single, simple page to verify its appearance and the presence of the title and navigation links.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on any page of the application, **When** the page loads, **Then** I should see a header at the top.
2. **Given** the header is visible, **When** I look at the header, **Then** I should see the application title "Catalog".
3. **Given** the header is visible, **When** I look at the header, **Then** I should see a "Domains" menu link.
4. **Given** the header is visible, **When** I look at the header, **Then** I should see a "Services" menu link.
5. **Given** a navigation link in the header points to an unavailable page, **When** I click the link, **Then** I should be shown a "Page Not Found" error.

### Edge Cases

- **Mobile View**: How the header responds to smaller screen sizes is not defined. For this initial version, a responsive layout is considered out of scope.
- **Long Title**: If the application title is excessively long, it should truncate gracefully (e.g., with an ellipsis).

## Constitutional Alignment *(mandatory)*

- **I. Clear Visual Representation**: The header provides a consistent visual anchor for the user, contributing to a clear and predictable user interface.
- **II. Bidirectional Traceability**: The navigation links in the header will allow users to begin tracing relationships from the top-down (e.g., from the Domains page).
- **III. Data Integrity and Uniqueness**: Not directly applicable to this feature, as it is primarily presentational.
- **IV. Architectural Insight**: This feature establishes the primary navigation structure, which is a key element of the application's architecture.
- **V. Extensibility and Modularity**: The header will be a modular component that can be extended with more navigation links or features in the future.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST display a header at the top of all pages.
- **FR-002**: The header MUST contain the application title, "Catalog".
- **FR-003**: The header MUST contain a navigation link that directs the user to the "Domains" page.
- **FR-004**: The header MUST contain a navigation link that directs the user to the "Services" page.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST navigate to a "Page Not Found" error page if a header link's target is unavailable.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: The header component MUST comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of pages in the application display the standard header.
- **SC-002**: A first-time user can successfully navigate to both the "Domains" and "Services" pages from the header in under 10 seconds.
