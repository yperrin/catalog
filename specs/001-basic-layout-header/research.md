# Research for Basic Application Layout with Header

This document outlines the research and decisions made for the implementation of the basic application layout.

## Performance Goals

- **Decision**: The header component should render in under 200ms.
- **Rationale**: This is a standard performance target for critical UI elements to ensure a smooth user experience. A fast-loading header is essential for a good first impression.
- **Alternatives considered**: No other alternatives were considered as this is a standard best practice.

## Constraints

- **Decision**: The header must adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards.
- **Rationale**: This is a common accessibility standard that ensures the application is usable by people with disabilities.
- **Alternatives considered**: WCAG 2.1 Level AAA was considered but deemed too strict for this initial implementation.

## Scale/Scope

- **Decision**: This is a foundational component for a small to medium-sized application.
- **Rationale**: The initial scope of the project is to build a catalog of domains and services, which is not expected to have a large number of users or a massive amount of data initially.
- **Alternatives considered**: None.
