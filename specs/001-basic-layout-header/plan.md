# Implementation Plan: Basic Application Layout with Header

**Branch**: `001-basic-layout-header` | **Date**: 10/31/2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-basic-layout-header/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of a basic application header component containing the application title and navigation links to the "Domains" and "Services" pages, as specified in the feature specification.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript (~5.9.2)
**Primary Dependencies**: Angular (~20.3.0), Nx (22.0.2)
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: Vitest, Playwright
**Target Platform**: Web Browser
**Project Type**: Web application
**Performance Goals**: The header component should render in under 200ms.
**Constraints**: Must adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards.
**Scale/Scope**: This is a foundational component for a small to medium-sized application.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Clear Visual Representation**: The header is a foundational UI element that contributes to the application's visual identity and navigation structure, which will be critical for the graph visualization.
- **II. Bidirectional Traceability**: The header provides the primary navigation links to the pages where bidirectional traceability will be implemented.
- **III. Data Integrity and Uniqueness**: Not applicable to this feature.
- **IV. Architectural Insight**: The header is a key component of the overall UI architecture.
- **V. Extensibility and Modularity**: The header will be implemented as a reusable Angular component, ensuring modularity and extensibility.

        └── header.spec.ts

tests/
└── e2e/
    └── header.spec.ts
```

**Structure Decision**: The project is a single web application, so the existing structure will be used. A new `header` component will be created within a `components` directory.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitutional violations to justify.
