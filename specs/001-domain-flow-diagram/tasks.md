# Tasks: Domain Flow Diagram

**Feature Branch**: `001-domain-flow-diagram`  
**Created**: 2025-11-01

## Phase 1: Setup

- [x] T001 Install d3.js and its types: `npm install d3 && npm install @types/d3 --save-dev`
- [x] T002 [P] Create a new component for the domain flow diagram: `npx nx generate @nx/angular:component --path=src/app/domains/domains/domain-flow`
- [x] T003 [P] Add a new route for the domain flow diagram page in `src/app/app.routes.ts`

## Phase 2: Foundational Tasks

*(No foundational tasks required for this feature)*

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - View Domain Flow Diagram

**Goal**: As a user, I want to be able to click an icon next to a domain that has a defined data flow, so that I can navigate to a new page and visualize the data flow for that domain.

**Independent Test Criteria**: This story can be tested by verifying that for a domain with a data flow, the icon is present, and clicking it navigates to the correct page with the domain information and a process diagram.

### Implementation Tasks

- [x] T004 [US1] Update the `domain-list.html` to conditionally display a navigation icon next to each domain that has a `dataFlowFile` property in `src/app/domains/domains/domain-list/domain-list.html`
- [x] T005 [US1] Implement the navigation logic in `domain-list.ts` to navigate to the domain flow diagram page when the icon is clicked in `src/app/domains/domains/domain-list/domain-list.ts`
- [x] T006 [US1] Implement the header of the domain flow diagram page to display the domain's name and description in `src/app/domains/domains/domain-flow/domain-flow.component.html`
- [x] T007 [US1] Implement the logic to fetch the data for the domain flow diagram in `src/app/domains/domains/domain-flow/domain-flow.component.ts`
- [x] T008 [US1] Implement the diagram rendering logic using d3.js in `src/app/domains/domains/domain-flow/domain-flow.component.ts`

## Final Phase: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [x] T009 Review and refactor the code for clarity and performance.
- [x] T010 Manually test the feature against all acceptance scenarios and edge cases defined in the specification.

## Dependencies

- User Story 1 is the only user story and has no dependencies.

## Parallel Execution

- Tasks marked with `[P]` can be executed in parallel.
- Within User Story 1, the UI and data fetching logic can be developed in parallel to some extent.

## Implementation Strategy

- The implementation will follow an MVP-first approach, focusing on delivering User Story 1 as a complete and testable increment.
