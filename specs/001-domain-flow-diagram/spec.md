# Feature Specification: Domain Flow Diagram

**Feature Branch**: `001-domain-flow-diagram`  
**Created**: 2025-11-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "for every domain listed, if we have a data-flow defined we need to add a navigation icon which will take us to a new page. The new page will have a header showing the domain and its information it will also have a process diagram showing the flow of the content through the processes based on the data contained in the data-flow json file"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Domain Flow Diagram (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to be able to click an icon next to a domain that has a defined data flow, so that I can navigate to a new page and visualize the data flow for that domain.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the feature and provides the primary user value.

**Independent Test**: This can be tested by verifying that for a domain with a data flow, the icon is present, and clicking it navigates to the correct page with the domain information and a process diagram.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on the domain list page, and a domain has a defined data flow, **When** the user views the domain in the list, **Then** a navigation icon is displayed next to the domain name.
2. **Given** a user is on the domain list page, and a domain does not have a defined data flow, **When** the user views the domain in the list, **Then** no navigation icon is displayed next to the domain name.
3. **Given** a user clicks the navigation icon for a domain with a defined data flow, **When** the new page loads, **Then** the page header displays the name and description of the domain.
4. **Given** a user is on the domain flow diagram page, **When** the page loads, **Then** a process diagram is displayed, showing the flow of data through the services as defined in the data-flow JSON file.

### Edge Cases

- If the `data-flow.json` file is malformed or contains invalid data, the system MUST display a user-friendly error message on the diagram page (e.g., "Could not load data flow diagram") and log the detailed error to the console for debugging.
- If a data flow exceeds a maximum threshold of nodes/edges, the system MUST display a warning and only render a truncated version of the diagram.
- What happens if a service in the data flow is not present in the main `services.json` file?

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-11-01

- Q: How should the system respond when it encounters a malformed or invalid `data-flow.json` file? → A: Display a user-friendly error message on the diagram page and log the detailed error to the console for debugging.
- Q: How should the system handle a data flow with a very large number of nodes and edges? → A: Set a maximum threshold for nodes/edges; if exceeded, display a warning and only render a truncated version of the diagram.

## Constitutional Alignment *(mandatory)*

- **I. Clear Visual Representation**: This feature directly implements the constitutional requirement for a clear visual representation of services by creating a process diagram for the data flow.
- **II. Bidirectional Traceability**: This feature enhances traceability by providing a visual representation of the dependencies between services for a specific domain.
- **III. Data Integrity and Uniqueness**: The feature relies on the integrity of the `data-flow` JSON files. The system should handle potential inconsistencies gracefully.
- **IV. Architectural Insight**: This feature provides significant architectural insight by visualizing how data flows through different services for a given domain.
- **V. Extensibility and Modularity**: The feature is designed in a modular way, with each domain's data flow defined in its own file, making it easy to add new data flows without changing the core application.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST display a navigation icon next to each domain in the domain list that has an associated `dataFlowFile` defined in `domains.json`.
- **FR-002**: Clicking the navigation icon MUST navigate the user to a new page dedicated to displaying the data flow for that domain.
- **FR-003**: The new data flow page MUST have a header that displays the name and description of the selected domain.
- **FR-004**: The data flow page MUST render a process diagram based on the `nodes` and `edges` defined in the corresponding data-flow JSON file.
- **FR-005**: The process diagram MUST visually distinguish between services that modify the data and those that do not, based on the `modifies` flag in the data-flow JSON file.
- **FR-006**: The process diagram MUST be a static, read-only visualization.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Domain**: Represents a business domain. Contains properties like name, description, and a reference to its data flow file.
- **Data Flow**: Represents the process of data moving through services for a specific domain. Contains a list of services (nodes) and the connections between them (edges).

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-11-01

- Q: How should the system respond when it encounters a malformed or invalid `data-flow.json` file? → A: Display a user-friendly error message on the diagram page and log the detailed error to the console for debugging.
- Q: How should the system handle a data flow with a very large number of nodes and edges? → A: Set a maximum threshold for nodes/edges; if exceeded, display a warning and only render a truncated version of the diagram.
- Q: Should the process diagram be interactive (e.g., allowing users to click on nodes for more details), or should it be a static, read-only visualization? → A: No, the diagram should be a static, read-only visualization for the initial implementation.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of domains with a defined `dataFlowFile` display the navigation icon.
- **SC-002**: Page load time for the data flow diagram page is less than 2 seconds for a diagram with up to 20 nodes.
- **SC-003**: Users can successfully navigate to and view the data flow diagram for any domain with a defined flow in 2 clicks or less from the domain list.
- **SC-004**: The rendered diagram accurately reflects the `nodes` and `edges` from the JSON file in 100% of cases.
