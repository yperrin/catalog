# Implementation Plan: Domain Flow Diagram

**Feature Branch**: `001-domain-flow-diagram`  
**Created**: 2025-11-01  
**Status**: In Progress

## Technical Context

- **Frameworks**: Angular, Nx
- **UI Libraries**: Angular Material
- **Key Dependencies**: A graph visualization library is needed to render the process diagram. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: The best library for this purpose needs to be determined. Candidates include d3.js, mermaid.js, or a dedicated Angular graph library.]
- **Integrations**: The feature will read data from `domains.json`, `services.json`, and the various `*-data-flow.json` files.

## Constitution Check

- **I. Clear Visual Representation**: PASS - This feature is centered around creating a clear visual representation of the data flow.
- **II. Bidirectional Traceability**: PASS - The diagram will enhance traceability for a domain's data flow.
- **III. Data Integrity and Uniqueness**: PASS - The feature relies on the integrity of the existing JSON data.
- **IV. Architectural Insight**: PASS - The feature directly provides architectural insight.
- **V. Extensibility and Modularity**: PASS - The design is modular, with each domain's flow in a separate file.

## Gates

- **Gate 1: Specification Complete**: PASS - The specification is well-defined and has been clarified.
- **Gate 2: Constitution Alignment**: PASS - The feature aligns with all constitutional principles.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

- **Task 1**: Research and select a suitable graph visualization library for Angular.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

- **Task 1**: Create `data-model.md` to document the data structures used in the feature.
- **Task 2**: Create `quickstart.md` with instructions on how to use the new feature.
- **Task 3**: Update agent context with new dependencies.

## Phase 2: Implementation

- **Task 1**: Create a new route and component for the domain flow diagram page.
- **Task 2**: Implement the domain list to display the navigation icon for domains with a data flow file.
- **Task 3**: Implement the domain flow diagram page header.
- **Task 4**: Implement the graph rendering logic using the selected library.

## Phase 3: Testing & Validation

- **Task 1**: Manually test the feature against the acceptance scenarios in the specification.
- **Task 2**: Perform exploratory testing to identify any edge cases not covered in the spec.
