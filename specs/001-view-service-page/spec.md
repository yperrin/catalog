# Feature Specification: View Service Page

**Feature Branch**: `001-view-service-page`  
**Created**: November 1, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "We need to create a view page for a single service. The page will include the service name and description. The we will show a table containing the list of domains passing though the service and a column indicating whether the service is modifying the data. The domain will have a link to the domain-flow page"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Service Details (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to view the details of a single service, including its name and description, so I can understand what the service does.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the request.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to a service's view page and verifying the name and description are displayed correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** I am on the service view page for "Service A", **When** the page loads, **Then** I see "Service A" as the service name and its description.

---

### User Story 2 - View Associated Domains (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to see a list of domains that pass through the service, along with an indication of whether the service modifies the data, so I can understand the service's impact on data flow.

**Why this priority**: This is a critical part of understanding the service's role in the data catalog.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to a service's view page and verifying the table of domains and their modification status is displayed correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** I am on the service view page for "Service A", **When** the page loads, **Then** I see a table listing all domains associated with "Service A" and a column indicating if "Service A" modifies the data for each domain.

---

### User Story 3 - Navigate to Domain Flow (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to be able to click on a domain in the table and be taken to its domain-flow page, so I can explore the data flow of that specific domain.

**Why this priority**: This provides essential navigation and deeper insight into the data catalog.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking on a domain in the table and verifying that the correct domain-flow page is loaded.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** I am on the service view page for "Service A" and I see "Domain X" in the associated domains table, **When** I click on "Domain X", **Then** I am navigated to the domain-flow page for "Domain X".

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a service has no associated domains? The table should display a message indicating no domains are associated.
- What happens when a service description is very long? The description should be displayed in a readable format, potentially with truncation and an option to expand.
- What happens if a domain in the table does not have a corresponding domain-flow page? The link should be disabled or lead to an appropriate error/not-found page.

## Constitutional Alignment *(mandatory)*

- **I. Clear Visual Representation**: This feature directly contributes to a clear visual representation by providing a dedicated page to view service details and their associated data flows.
- **II. Bidirectional Traceability**: This feature enhances traceability by showing which domains pass through a service and providing links to their individual domain-flow pages.
- **III. Data Integrity and Uniqueness**: The display of data modification status helps in understanding data integrity aspects related to the service.
- **IV. Architectural Insight**: By showing service details and their domain interactions, this feature provides insights into the system's architecture.
- **V. Extensibility and Modularity**: The service view page should be designed as a modular component, allowing for easy extension with more service-related information in the future.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST display the name of the selected service.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST display the description of the selected service.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST display a table of domains associated with the selected service.
- **FR-004**: The table of domains MUST include a column indicating whether the service modifies the data for each domain.
- **FR-005**: Each domain in the table MUST be a clickable link that navigates to its corresponding domain-flow page.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST handle cases where a service has no associated domains gracefully (e.g., display "No associated domains").
- **FR-007**: The system MUST handle cases where a domain link leads to a non-existent domain-flow page (e.g., disable link or show error).
- **FR-008**: All information displayed on the service view page MUST be considered public within the organization and contain no sensitive data.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST display a loading spinner or skeleton screen while data for the service view page is being loaded.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Service**: Represents a functional unit. Key attributes: Name (unique), Description.
- **Domain**: Represents a data entity. Key attributes: Name (unique), Link to Domain Flow.
- **ServiceDomainRelationship**: Represents the relationship between a Service and a Domain. Key attributes: DataModificationStatus (boolean).

## Clarifications

### Session November 1, 2025

- Q: What specific functionalities are explicitly out of scope for this initial version of the service view page? → A: No integration or edits.
- Q: How are Service and Domain entities uniquely identified? → A: By their name, which must be unique.
- Q: What are the security and privacy considerations for displaying service and domain information? → A: All displayed information is considered public within the organization; no sensitive data.
- Q: How should the UI behave while data for the service view page is being loaded? → A: Display a loading spinner or skeleton screen.
- Q: What are the reliability and availability expectations for the service view page? → A: Basic availability is sufficient; occasional downtime is acceptable.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Out of Scope

- **OOS-001**: Direct editing of service or domain details from this page is out of scope.
- **OOS-002**: Integration with external systems for real-time service status updates is out of scope.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can view the service name and description within 2 seconds of navigating to the service view page.
- **SC-002**: Users can identify all domains associated with a service and their data modification status with 100% accuracy.
- **SC-003**: Users can successfully navigate from a domain in the service view page to its corresponding domain-flow page 100% of the time.
- **SC-004**: The service view page accurately reflects the current state of service-domain relationships as defined in the data catalog.
- **SC-005**: Occasional downtime for the service view page is acceptable, reflecting basic availability requirements.
