# API Contracts: View Service Page

This feature will consume data via existing Angular services (`DomainService`, `ServiceService`) which are responsible for fetching and managing data related to domains and services. No new API endpoints or contracts are being defined as part of this feature.

The data models for Service, Domain, and ServiceDomainRelationship are described in `data-model.md`.
