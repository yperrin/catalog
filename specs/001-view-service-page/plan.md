# Implementation Plan: View Service Page

**Branch**: `001-view-service-page` | **Date**: November 1, 2025 | **Spec**: C:\Projects\experiments\catalog\specs\001-view-service-page\spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-view-service-page/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

The feature is to create a view page for a single service, displaying its name, description, and a table of associated domains. The table will indicate if the service modifies data for each domain, and domain names will link to their respective domain-flow pages. Angular Signals will be used for state management within the component.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript (Angular)
**Primary Dependencies**: Angular, Nx, RxJS, Angular Signals
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: Playwright (E2E), Karma/Jasmine (Unit)
**Target Platform**: Web
**Project Type**: Web (Angular application)
**Performance Goals**: Users can view the service name and description within 2 seconds of navigating to the service view page.
**Constraints**: No direct editing of service or domain details. No integration with external systems for real-time status updates. All displayed information is public within the organization.
**Scale/Scope**: Display details for a single service and its associated domains.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Clear Visual Representation**: The feature provides a dedicated page to view service details and their associated data flows, directly contributing to clear visual representation.
- **II. Bidirectional Traceability**: The feature enhances traceability by showing which domains pass through a service and providing links to their individual domain-flow pages.
- **III. Data Integrity and Uniqueness**: The feature relies on the uniqueness of domains and services (identified by name) and displays data modification status, aiding in understanding data integrity.
- **IV. Architectural Insight**: By showing service details and their domain interactions, this feature provides insights into the system's architecture.
- **V. Extensibility and Modularity**: The service view page will be designed as a modular component, allowing for easy extension with more service-related information in the future.

```

**Structure Decision**: The service view page will be implemented as a new Angular component within `src/app/domains/services/service-view/`. Routing will be configured in `src/app/domains/services/service-view.routes.ts`. Existing `domain.service.ts` and `service.service.ts` will be utilized for data retrieval.

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
