# Tasks: Domain Catalog Management

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-domain-catalog/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), data-model.md

**Tests**: Tests are not included in this task list as per user request.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

**Constitutional Alignment**: When creating tasks, ensure they align with the project constitution's principles:
- **I. Clear Visual Representation**
- **II. Bidirectional Traceability**
- **III. Data Integrity and Uniqueness**
- **IV. Architectural Insight**
- **V. Extensibility and Modularity**

## Path Conventions

- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [X] T001 Create project structure: `src/app/domains/domain-list/`, `src/app/shared/models/`, `src/app/shared/services/`
- [X] T002 Initialize Angular project with Nx dependencies (already done, placeholder)
- [X] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools (already done, placeholder)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T004 Create `Domain` interface in `src/app/shared/models/domain.model.ts`
- [X] T005 Create and initialize 'domains.json' file in the assets folder with an empty array.
- [X] T006 Implement `DomainService` with basic JSON file interaction (read/write) in `src/app/shared/services/domain.service.ts`

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - View Domain List (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Users can navigate to the domains page and see a comprehensive list of all domains currently stored in the system.

**Independent Test**: Navigate to the domains page and observe the displayed list of domains.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T007 Import `HttpClientModule` in `src/app/app.config.ts` to enable HTTP requests.
- [X] T008 [US1] Create `DomainList` in `src/app/domains/domain-list/domain-list.ts`
- [X] T009 [US1] Implement `DomainList` template (`domain-list.html`) to display a list of domains
- [X] T010 [US1] Implement `DomainList` styling (`domain-list.css`)
- [X] T011 [US1] Implement logic in `DomainList` to fetch domains using `DomainService`
- [X] T012 [US1] Handle empty list scenario in `DomainList` template

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Filter Domain List (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Users can filter the displayed list of domains on the domains page by entering text into a search or filter field.

**Independent Test**: Enter a filter term and observe that only matching domains are displayed, then clear the filter to see all domains again.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T019 [US3] Add filter input to `DomainList` template (`domain-list.html`)
- [X] T020 [US3] Implement filtering logic in `DomainList` (case-insensitive partial match)
- [X] T021 [US3] Handle no matching domains scenario in `DomainList` template

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

## Final Phase: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [X] T025 Implement WCAG 2.1 Level A accessibility for all components
- [X] T026 Code cleanup and refactoring
- [X] T027 Performance optimization (if needed after initial implementation)

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create `DomainList` in src/app/domains/domain-list/domain-list.ts"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
