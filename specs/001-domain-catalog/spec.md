# Feature Specification: Domain Catalog Management

**Feature Branch**: `001-domain-catalog`
**Created**: October 31, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "we want to be able to store and add to a list of domains. The data should be stored in a json file. The user will be prompted for name and description when adding a new domain. In the home page, the user will be shown the list of all the domains but will be able to filter the list by name"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Domain List (Priority: P1)

Users can navigate to the domains page and see a comprehensive list of all domains currently stored in the system. This provides an immediate overview of the cataloged domains.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational viewing capability, allowing users to access the core information of the system. Without it, the catalog has no visible content.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to the domains page and observing the displayed list of domains. It delivers value by providing visibility into the existing domain catalog.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** the user is on the domains page, **When** the page loads, **Then** a list of all stored domains is displayed.
2.  **Given** there are no domains stored, **When** the page loads, **Then** an empty list or a message indicating no domains are found is displayed.

### User Story 3 - Filter Domain List (Priority: P2)

Users can filter the displayed list of domains on the domains page by entering text into a search or filter field. This allows them to quickly find specific domains within a potentially large list.

**Why this priority**: While not strictly essential for initial functionality, filtering significantly enhances usability and efficiency for users managing a growing number of domains.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering a filter term and observing that only matching domains are displayed, and then clearing the filter to see all domains again. It delivers value by improving navigation and search within the catalog.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a list of domains is displayed, **When** the user enters text into a filter field, **Then** only domains whose names contain the filter text (case-insensitive) are displayed.
2.  **Given** a filter is applied and matching domains are displayed, **When** the user clears the filter text, **Then** all domains are displayed again.
3.  **Given** a filter is applied, **When** no domains match the filter text, **Then** a message indicating no matching domains are found is displayed.

## Constitutional Alignment *(mandatory)*

-   **I. Clear Visual Representation**: This feature will provide the foundational data for visualizing domains and their relationships. The domains page will visually represent the list of domains, which can then be enhanced with graph-based visualizations.
-   **II. Bidirectional Traceability**: This feature establishes the initial set of domains, which will later be linked to services, enabling traceability between domains and their associated services.
-   **III. Data Integrity and Uniqueness**: Domain names will be enforced as unique identifiers. The system will ensure that new domains have both a name and a description, maintaining data quality. Access to view, add, and filter domains will be publicly accessible without authentication.
-   **IV. Architectural Insight**: By cataloging domains, this feature contributes to a clearer understanding of the system's architecture by providing a structured list of its logical components.
-   **V. Extensibility and Modularity**: The domain management functionality will be designed as a modular component, allowing for future extensions such as editing, deleting, or associating services and other entities without impacting core domain listing.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

-   **FR-002**: The system MUST store domain data persistently in a JSON file.
-   **FR-003**: The system MUST display a list of all stored domains on the domains page.
-   **FR-004**: The system MUST allow users to filter the displayed domain list by domain name (case-insensitive partial match).
-   **FR-009**: The system is designed for best effort reliability; data loss is acceptable in case of system failure.
-   **FR-010**: The user interface MUST adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level A accessibility standards.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

-   **Domain**: Represents a logical grouping or area of concern within the system.
    -   **Name**: A unique, human-readable identifier for the domain (string).
    -   **Description**: A brief explanation of the domain's purpose and scope (string).

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

-   **SC-002**: The domains page loads and displays the complete list of domains within 2 seconds for a catalog containing up to 500 domains.
-   **SC-003**: Filtering a list of 500 domains by name displays the relevant results within 1 second of the user typing a filter term.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-31

- Q: What are the security requirements for accessing and managing domains? → A: No authentication required; all actions are publicly accessible.
- Q: What is the expected maximum number of domains the system should be designed to support while maintaining acceptable performance? → A: Up to 500 domains.
- Q: What are the expectations for the system's reliability, specifically regarding uptime and data recovery in case of failure? → A: Best effort; data loss is acceptable in case of system failure.
- Q: Should the user interface be designed to meet specific accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG)? → A: Adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level A.
