# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

The feature enables users to manage a catalog of domains on a dedicated "domains page". Users can view domains. Domains are stored in a local JSON file. The system ensures unique domain names and provides filtering capabilities. The UI adheres to WCAG 2.1 Level A, and access is public. The system is designed for best-effort reliability and supports up to 500 domains. No API contracts are needed as data is stored locally.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript (Angular)
**Primary Dependencies**: Angular, Nx
**Storage**: JSON file
**Testing**: Nx (Karma/Jasmine for unit, Playwright for e2e)
**Target Platform**: Web Browser
**Project Type**: Web application
**Performance Goals**: Domains page loads and displays 500 domains within 2 seconds; filtering 500 domains displays results within 1 second.
**Constraints**: WCAG 2.1 Level A accessibility; publicly accessible (no authentication); best effort reliability (data loss acceptable).
**Scale/Scope**: Up to 500 domains.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Clear Visual Representation**: Pass. The plan involves displaying a list of domains, which is a visual representation and lays groundwork for future graph-based visualizations.
- **II. Bidirectional Traceability**: Pass. This feature establishes the initial set of domains, which will later be linked to services, enabling traceability.
- **III. Data Integrity and Uniqueness**: Pass. The system will enforce unique domain names and prevent duplicates.
- **IV. Architectural Insight**: Pass. Cataloging domains contributes to a clearer understanding of the system's architecture.
- **V. Extensibility and Modularity**: Pass. The domain management functionality is designed as a modular component, allowing for future extensions.

│   └── shared/
│       └── services/
│           └── domain.service.ts  # For JSON file interaction
└── assets/
```

**Structure Decision**: The project will follow the existing Angular/Nx structure. New components for domain listing will be created under `src/app/domains/`. A shared service `domain.service.ts` will handle interaction with the local JSON file.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
