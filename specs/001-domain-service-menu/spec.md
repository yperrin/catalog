# Feature Specification: Domain and Service Menus

**Feature Branch**: `001-domain-service-menu`  
**Created**: 2025-10-31  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "create the basic structure for domains and services menu. Create a home page for each one which will introduce the user to each of the functions"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-31

- Q: How should the "empty state" be displayed on the Domains and Services home pages when no items have been added yet? → A: Display a message like "No domains found. Get started by adding a new one." with a button to add a new domain.
- Q: What should be the content of the user-friendly error message when navigation fails? → A: "Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again later."
- Q: Are there any specific scalability requirements for the number of domains and services the application should support? → A: No specific scalability requirements at this time.
- Q: Are there any specific security or privacy requirements for accessing the domains and services pages? → A: Access to these pages is public and does not require authentication.
- Q: What level of logging or metrics should be implemented for the new navigation and pages? → A: No specific observability requirements at this time.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Navigate to Domains (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to see a "Domains" menu item in the main navigation so that I can access the list of domains. When I click on it, I should be taken to a home page that introduces the domains section.

**Why this priority**: This is a primary navigation element and a core feature of the application.

**Independent Test**: The "Domains" menu item should be visible and clickable, and it should navigate to the correct page.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on any page in the application, **When** I look at the main navigation, **Then** I should see a "Domains" menu item.
2. **Given** I am on any page, **When** I click the "Domains" menu item, **Then** I am taken to the "/domains" page.
3. **Given** I am on the "/domains" page, **Then** I see a title and introductory text about the domains feature.

### User Story 2 - Navigate to Services (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to see a "Services" menu item in the main navigation so that I can access the list of services. When I click on it, I should be taken to a home page that introduces the services section.

**Why this priority**: This is a primary navigation element and a core feature of the application.

**Independent Test**: The "Services" menu item should be visible and clickable, and it should navigate to the correct page.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on any page in the application, **When** I look at the main navigation, **Then** I should see a "Services" menu item.
2. **Given** I am on any page, **When** I click the "Services" menu item, **Then** I am taken to the "/services" page.
3. **Given** I am on the "/services" page, **Then** I see a title and introductory text about the services feature.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the list of domains or services is empty? The home page should display a message like "No domains found. Get started by adding a new one." with a button to add a new domain.
- How does the system handle a failed navigation attempt? A user-friendly error message like "Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again later." should be displayed.

## Constitutional Alignment *(mandatory)*

- **I. Clear Visual Representation**: This feature will provide the foundational structure for visualizing domains and services. The home pages will serve as the entry point for these visualizations.
- **II. Bidirectional Traceability**: This feature enables traceability by creating dedicated sections for domains and services, which will later show their relationships.
- **III. Data Integrity and Uniqueness**: Initially, this feature deals with navigation. Data integrity for domains and services will be handled when those features are more fully implemented.
- **IV. Architectural Insight**: The menus will provide insight into the high-level organization of the system (domains and services).
- **V. Extensibility and Modularity**: The menu and routing structure is modular and can be easily extended with new sections in the future.

## Assumptions

- The main navigation bar is already present in the application.
- The application has a routing system in place.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST display a "Domains" link in the main navigation.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST display a "Services" link in the main navigation.
- **FR-003**: Clicking the "Domains" link MUST navigate the user to the `/domains` route.
- **FR-004**: Clicking the "Services" link MUST navigate the user to the `/services` route.
- **FR-005**: The `/domains` route MUST display a home page with a title and introductory text.
- **FR-006**: The `/services` route MUST display a home page with a title and introductory text.
- **FR-007**: The content of the home pages MUST display a simple title and a brief paragraph explaining the purpose of the section.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Scalability: No specific scalability requirements at this time.
- **NFR-002**: Security: Access to the Domains and Services home pages is public and does not require authentication.
- **NFR-003**: Observability: No specific observability requirements at this time.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Domain**: Represents a logical grouping of services. Key attributes: name, description.
- **Service**: Represents a single service within a domain. Key attributes: name, description, domain (relationship).

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of users can successfully navigate to the Domains and Services home pages.
- **SC-002**: The navigation to either home page takes less than 500ms.
- **SC-003**: The new menu items do not negatively impact the accessibility score of the navigation bar.
