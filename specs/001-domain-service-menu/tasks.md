# Tasks: Domain and Service Menus

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-domain-service-menu/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [X] T001 [P] Create Domains home page component in `src/app/pages/domains/home.ts`
- [X] T002 [P] Create Services home page component in `src/app/pages/services/home.ts`
- [X] T003 [P] Create routes for Domains and Services home pages in `src/app/app.routes.ts`

---

## Phase 2: User Story 1 - Navigate to Domains (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

**Goal**: Users can navigate to the Domains section of the application.

**Independent Test**: The "Domains" menu item is visible, clickable, and navigates to the correct page.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T004 [US1] Implement the "Domains" menu item in the main navigation header component in `src/app/components/header/header.ts`
- [X] T005 [US1] Implement the Domains home page component with a title and introductory text in `src/app/pages/domains/home.ts`

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 3: User Story 2 - Navigate to Services (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Users can navigate to the Services section of the application.

**Independent Test**: The "Services" menu item is visible, clickable, and navigates to the correct page.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T006 [US2] Implement the "Services" menu item in the main navigation header component in `src/app/components/header/header.ts`
- [X] T007 [US2] Implement the Services home page component with a title and introductory text in `src/app/pages/services/home.ts`

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 4: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [X] T008 [P] Implement the empty state display for the Domains home page in `src/app/pages/domains/home.ts`
- [X] T009 [P] Implement the empty state display for the Services home page in `src/app/pages/services/home.ts`
- [X] T010 [P] Implement error handling for failed navigation in `src/app/app.ts`

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **User Stories (Phase 2 & 3)**: All depend on Setup phase completion
- **Polish (Phase 4)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Setup (Phase 1) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Setup (Phase 1) - No dependencies on other stories

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Once Setup phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: User Story 1
3. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
4. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup
2. Add User Story 1 â†’ Test independently â†’ Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 â†’ Test independently â†’ Deploy/Demo
