# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This feature introduces the basic structure for the domains and services menus, including home pages for each section. The technical approach involves creating new Angular components and routes within the existing Nx workspace.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript
**Primary Dependencies**: Angular, Nx
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: Playwright, Jest/Vitest
**Target Platform**: Web
**Project Type**: Web application
**Performance Goals**: <500ms navigation
**Constraints**: N/A
**Scale/Scope**: 2 new pages/routes

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Clear Visual Representation**: Yes, the plan provides the foundation for future visualizations.
- **II. Bidirectional Traceability**: Yes, the structure supports future traceability features.
- **III. Data Integrity and Uniqueness**: N/A for this feature, as it does not handle data persistence.
- **IV. Architectural Insight**: Yes, the menu structure provides high-level architectural insight.
- **V. Extensibility and Modularity**: Yes, the design is modular and extensible.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
